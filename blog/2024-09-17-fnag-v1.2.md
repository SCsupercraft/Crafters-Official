Five Nights At Gru's version 1.2 is out! It is currently only available as a [scratch project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1064861616/), but will have an exe version shortly. Additionally I have found a way to make the executables around 225MB smaller, which means that FNAG should take around 75MB on your computer.
