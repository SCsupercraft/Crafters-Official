We have a new website! (The one you are on right now).\
Thanks to Docusaurus this new website was made possible.

<!-- truncate -->

There are a few reasons why we are using Docusaurus, firstly Docusaurus is built using React making it easier to develop the site. Next Docusaurus is powered by MDX, which will save lots of time creating new pages. MDX is also very powerful since it has plugins and you can even use React inside of MDX. Of course there are plenty of other features but I'm not going to list them all, if you want more information about Docusaurus and what it can do check out [Docusaurus' official website](https://docusaurus.io/docs/category/guides).
